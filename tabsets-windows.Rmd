Can be sometimes useful for homework and other text that should be show conditionally.

## Tabsets {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Creating tabsets

You can create tabsets from Rmarkdown using `## Your-title {.tabset}` as a header. All headers of lower order (e.g. `###`) will be organized into tabs.

### Customizing tabsets

You can use `{.tabset .tabset-pills}` to make the tabs arguably prettier. For more info, see [Rmarkdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-tabs.html).


## Rolling windows

To hide some text (e.g. homework solution) until a botton is clicked, use the following HTML code.


<details><summary>Show HTML code</summary>

Create a rolling window by using 

`<details><summary>Title</summary> Hidden text here </details>`

</details>
