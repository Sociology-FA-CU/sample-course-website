## HTML presentations

- You can create html presentations that can be viewed without downloading a local copy. There many ways to do it, most of our courses are using [ioslides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html).
- Do not store .Rmd files for presentations in the root folder, or Rmarkdown will force them to be a normal html webpage. Create a custom folder for them.

## Customizing ioslides

- ioslides presentation can be somewhat customized using YAML, but more extensive changes require CSS.
- CSS file can be linked in the YAML of the .Rmd file (see the .Rmd document for this presentation)
